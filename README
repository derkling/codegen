Codegen
=======

A proof-of-concept implementation for a polymorphic stream-processing execution
engine.


Usage
=====

Build with

  $ make demo

this will generate the 'demo' core engine which provides support for XML to C++
code generation as well as the flow to build and run one of the programs
defined within the XML descriptor.

To run a demo:

 $ ./demo <xml_poduct>


Testing
=======

To profile timing for code generation a couple of simple Make targets have been
provided. The examples generate sample code, compile it, link it with the core
engine and jump to the program entry point.
Test examples are provided by XML files names build_N.xml where N = {100, 300, 1000}
is the number of program step to generate.

Run the tests with:

  $ make test100 test300 test1000

NOTE: this profiling should be preferably done at a fixed CPU frequency.
On a Linux machine, the provided setfreq shell script could be used to set
the CPU governor to usermode and select one of the supported frequencies.
For example:

  # ./setfreq.sh userspace 700000
